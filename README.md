# Elemental Clash

![Site view across different devices](/assets/images/)

Elemental Clash is an online game of chance based on the classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. Our goal is to create a fun experience for our users and fill the challengers with a feeling of joy and excitement as they battle the computer to see who the champion of Rock, Paper, Scissors can be. The users we expect to see visit this website and our estimated target audience would be those who played the game as a child, perhaps as a school-yard game, or those who are new to it and want to experience the classic game for the first time. Elemental Clash is for everyone.

Elemental Clash is a live webpage, it can be viewed [here]:

## Testing

### Validator Testing
- HTML

- CSS

- JavaScript

### De-bugging:
- Fixed an issue where the buttons were not centralised like the other part of the website, they were always off to the left of the screen. In the CSS file, I had set the display to flex which messed with the position of the buttons. I went into inspect element of the website and played around with removing and adding CSS and found removing the code fixed this issue.
