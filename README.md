# Elemental Clash

![Site view across different devices](/assets/images/)

Elemental Clash is an online game of chance based on the classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. Our goal is to create a fun experience for our users and fill the challengers with a feeling of joy and excitement as they battle the computer to see who the champion of Rock, Paper, Scissors can be. The users we expect to see visit this website and our estimated target audience would be those who played the game as a child, perhaps as a school-yard game, or those who are new to it and want to experience the classic game for the first time. Elemental Clash is for everyone.

Elemental Clash is a live webpage, it can be viewed [here]:

## Testing
- I tested the website on multiple browsers: Chrome and Firefox.
- I confirm that my website is responsive. It's form fits well to different devices and all standard screen sizes, and tested this through the devtools device toolbar.

### Validator Testing
- HTML: No errors were returned during this test using the [W3C validator]()

- CSS: 

- JavaScript:

### De-bugging:
- Fixed an issue where the buttons were not centralised like the other part of the website, they were always off to the left of the screen. In the CSS file, I had set the display to flex which messed with the position of the buttons. I went into inspect element of the website and played around with removing and adding CSS and found removing the code fixed this issue.
- Fixed and issue where the logo was off center on small devices. I tested different widths within the CSS but it didnt make it central or smaller. I had to make a media query for smaller devices in order for this change to work and not affect it on larger screens.
- Fixed an issue with the JavaScript where the class name wasnt matching correctly with the code within the JavaScrip section causing the function to not work.
- Fixed an issue where I was not able to deploy the website due to the index.html, and style.css files being within another file. I separated the files and was then able to deploy the site on Github.
